# SG Read Already?

## Bridging the Digital Divide with Compassion and Innovation

An encounter with an elderly woman, struggling to understand a document due to limited English proficiency and aging vision, left a lasting impact on me. This moment underscored the digital divide that persists despite technological advancements. In Singapore, a significant portion of seniors faces challenges with digital tasks, a gap that technology should bridge, not widen.

### Introduction

"SG read already?" is a web application developed to enhance digital inclusivity, empowering the elderly and visually impaired to understand their documents with ease. By simplifying the interaction to something as familiar as scanning a QR code, this app allows users to take a photo of a document, select their language, and receive a summarised, translated version via text-to-speech.

This project is not just a tool but a mission to ensure technology's reach extends to all, making the digital world accessible and inclusive.
